What is Nexus?
--------------

Nexus is a framework of tools that can be used to create most of the applications on
the internet as we know it today. The core implementation is of a digital currency
that rides on the backbones of the network and provides a stable storage and transmission
of value from party to party.

Nexus is a connection between two or more things, with this following code being a set of
tools to facilitate this connection between individuals.

Why Nexus?
----------

Nexus provides the ability to improve the technology in digital currencies in the form of
continued development of new architecture, organizations, financial contracts, and even
distributed consensus and voting with the proper checks and balances. When the entire
framework is complete, it will provide value to many other currencies besides nexus, and
be capable of allowing the world to form structured systems together that can operate
independent of one another, and be connected through the distributed network. This will
create greater opportunity for those that have limited access to such things.

Development
-----------

Anyone is free to work on the source, `master` branch is regularly build and tested, but do
not consider it completely stable until full releases. Please submit pull requests at your
discretion if you would like to contribute to the core codebase. A contributing schematic
will be provided soon on our standard for development.
