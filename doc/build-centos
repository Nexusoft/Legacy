## Dependency Build Instructions: Ubuntu & Debian

1. First ensure you have build essentials installed:

       sudo apt-get install build-essential
    
2. Install Boost:

       sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
    
3. Install Berklee DB:

       sudo apt-get install libdb-dev libdb++-dev
    
4. Install Open SSL:

       sudo apt-get install libssl1.0-dev
    
   * If this fails to install because your linux system still supports 0.X
     versions of openssl use this command:
   
         sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
    
5. Install Mini UPNP:

       sudo apt-get install libminiupnpc-dev
    
6. Install QrenCode:

       sudo apt-get install libqrencode-dev
    
7. For the Qt, install QT Framework:

       sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev

* If you get a failed to build because "-lz" was not found this is due to the
fact that your linux operating system is trying to use a 64 bit version of
zlib. You can solve this by installing the 32 bit version here:

       sudo apt-get install lib32z1-dev
